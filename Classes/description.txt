Free copies everywhere!

Humans think they have the best technology on earth, but they are worng... Just take the 3D Printer made by Goats for example: it can print objects in no time, it can provide an infinite ammount of compies, and copies are made with an unbreakable material!

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This mod is one of the very first things I tried to do in this game: I wanted to do that in the Cloning Goat mod at the beginning. But my understanding of Unreal Script was too low at this time and I couldn't find a way to make any object copiable...
Anyway, when I was working on Spy Goat, I found a way to make explosives object that could bee copies of any objects. And I realized that this methods could also be used to produce normal copies of everything :) And that's how I made the copies of static objects.
Then I thought about making copies of creatures too, I knew the Cloning Goat already did that, but I wanted "dummy" copies, not living copies. So after a few tries I found that the best method for that was to create a "goat" actor, change it's skin and activate "frozen ragdoll" on it.
